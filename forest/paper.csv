STIGMATIZING ATTITUDES AROUND SUCH BROADCAST CAN LIMIT HELP-SEEKING AND INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF DEATH. TO REDUCE STIGMATIZING ATTITUDES, THIS PAPER AIMS TO DETECT STIGMA EXPRESSIONS IN SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS THROUGH LANGUAGE USE PATTERNS AND THEN IDENTIFY SUICIDE LITERACY IN RESPONSES TO SUCH BROADCAST. METHODSFIRSTLY, TO EXAMINE LINGUISTIC PATTERNS OF STIGMA EXPRESSIONS, 6632 WEIBO POSTS WITH KEYWORDS WERE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED. USING 102 LINGUISTIC FEATURES, 2 CLASSIFICATION MODELS WERE BUILT: ONE FOR DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN STIGMATIZING AND NONSTIGMATIZING ATTITUDES, AND ONE FOR DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN SPECIFIC TYPES OF STIGMATIZING ATTITUDES. SECONDLY, TO IDENTIFY THE LEVELS OF SUICIDE LITERACY, A CONTENT ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED ON 4969 WEIBO POSTS RELATED TO SOCIAL MEDIA SUICIDE. RESULTSFIRSTLY, THE MODEL ACCURACY RANGED FROM 66.15% TO 72.79%. SECONDLY, A TOTAL OF 11.67% OF THE WEIBO POSTS (N=580) CONTAINED MISINFORMATION ABOUT SUICIDE. IN THE CATEGORY OF KNOWLEDGE OF SIGNS, 27.93% AND 18.10% OF POSTS ENDORSED THE STIGMATIZING VIEWS THAT SUICIDE HAPPENS WITHOUT WARNING AND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO ATTEMPT SUICIDE CANNOT CHANGE THEIR MIND QUICKLY, BOTH OF WHICH WERE RELATED TO A STIGMATIZING BELIEF THAT A SUICIDE ATTEMPT ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS NOT GENUINE. IN THE CATEGORY OF KNOWLEDGE OF TREATMENTS, 35.17% OF POSTS ENDORSED THE STIGMATIZING VIEW THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE THOUGHTS ABOUT SUICIDE SHOULD NOT TELL OTHERS ABOUT IT.

IN OUR PREVIOUS RESEARCH YOUNG PEOPLE OBTAINED VERY LOW SCORES IN ALL MEDIA LITERACY DIMENSIONS EXCEPT TECHNOLOGY, DEMONSTRATING THE NEED FOR COMPREHENSIVE MEDIA LITERACY AND CONTRADICTING THE MYTH OF DIGITAL NATIVE. IT WAS SHOWN THAT THEY HAD TECHNICAL AND PRODUCTION SKILLS BUT WERE LACKING IN OTHERS OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE SUCH AS AESTHETICS. YOUNG PEOPLE DO NOT CONCEIVE THEIR LIVES ON AND OFFLINE SEPARATELY FOR THEM EVERYTHING IS A CONTINUATION OF PERSONAL, SOCIAL OR ACADEMIC LIFE. THEREFORE, WHY NOT INTRODUCE INTO HIGHER EDUCATION THE TECHNOLOGIES WITH WHICH THEY SPEND MOST TIME, THAT IS, MOBILE DEVICES? TABLETS AND MOBILE DEVICES ARE THEIR PERSONAL INTERACTION AND SOCIAL CONNECTION SPACES. INCLUDING THEM IN CLASSROOMS MAY THEREFORE BE USEFUL IN REMOVING THE BARRIERS THAT SEPARATE THE PERSONAL FROM THE COLLECTIVE, THE RATIONAL AND THE EMOTIONAL, LEARNING AND ENTERTAINMENT, THE CLASSROOM AND EVERYDAY LIFE OUTSIDE IT.

WE PRESENT THE EDUCATIONAL SETTING AND THE EMI DEBATE IN EACH OF THESE COUNTRIES AND SUMMARIZE RELEVANT RESEARCH FINDINGS. WE THEN MAKE SOME TENTATIVE SUGGESTIONS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF EMI IN HIGHER EDUCATION IN OTHER COUNTRIES. IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE INTERESTED IN UNIVERSITY LANGUAGE POLICIES AND THEIR RELEVANCE FOR THE DAY-TO-DAY WORK OF FACULTY. WE PROBLEMATIZE ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL UNIVERSITY LANGUAGE POLICIES, SUGGESTING THAT IN ORDER FOR POLICIES TO BE SEEN AS RELEVANT THEY NEED TO BE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT DISCIPLINARY DIFFERENCES. IN THIS RESPECT, WE MAKE SOME SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS ABOUT THE CONTENT OF UNIVERSITY LANGUAGE POLICIES AND EMI COURSE SYLLABUSES. HERE WE RECOMMEND THAT UNIVERSITY LANGUAGE POLICIES SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE DISCUSSION OF DISCIPLINARY LITERACY GOALS AND REQUIRE COURSE SYLLABUSES TO DETAIL DISCIPLINARY-SPECIFIC LANGUAGE-LEARNING OUTCOMES.","UNIVERSITY LANGUAGE POLICY; BILINGUALISM; DISCIPLINARY LITERACY;;   ENGLISH-MEDIUM INSTRUCTION; NORDIC LANGUAGE POLICY","ARTICLE","J","ENGLISH","AIREY, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), LINNAEUS UNIV, DEPT LANGUAGES, KALMAR, SWEDEN.; AIREY, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), UPPSALA UNIV, DEPT PHYS & ASTRON, UNIV PHYS EDUC RES GRP, UPPSALA, SWEDEN.","0018-1560","1573-174X","HIGH EDUC","HIGH.

IN ORDER FOR SUCH PROGRAMS TO BE EFFECTIVE, THE TEACHING AND LEARNING EXPERIENCES MUST BE TAILORED TO THEIR SPECIFIC CULTURAL CONTEXT. MEDIA IN THE SPOTLIGHT IS AN ALCOHOL MEDIA LITERACY PROGRAM AIMED AT 9 TO 12 YEAR OLD AUSTRALIAN CHILDREN. THIS STUDY EVALUATES THE PROCESS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM, OUTLINING THE FACTORS THAT FACILITATED AND INHIBITED IMPLEMENTATION. FROM THIS EVALUATION, A PEDAGOGICAL FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN DEVELOPED FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IMPLEMENTING CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE PROGRAMS IN SCHOOL SETTINGS. METHODS: PROCESS MEASURES INCLUDED: SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH TEACHERS BEFORE AND AFTER THE PROGRAM WAS IMPLEMENTED (N = 11 INTERVIEWS), PROGRAM EVALUATION QUESTIONNAIRES COMPLETED BY CHILDREN (N = 166), LESSON OBSERVATIONS COMPLETED BY TEACHERS (N = 35 OBSERVATIONS), AND REFLECTIVE JOURNAL ENTRIES COMPLETED BY THE RESEARCHER (N = 44 ENTRIES). A THEMATIC ANALYSIS APPROACH WAS USED TO ANALYSE ALL OF THE DATA SETS USING NVIVO. INDUCTIVE CODING WAS USED, WHEREBY THE FINDINGS WERE DERIVED FROM THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND MULTIPLE READINGS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THE DATA. RESULTS: FIVE KEY PEDAGOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED THAT FACILITATED IMPLEMENTATION. THESE WERE: CONNECTING TO THE STUDENTS' LIFE WORLDS TO ACHIEVE CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE EMPOWERING STUDENTS WITH REAL-WORLD SKILLS TO ENSURE RELEVANCE ENSURING PROGRAMS ARE WELL STRUCTURED WITH STRONG CONNECTIONS TO THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM CREATING DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE ACTIVITIES WHILE PROVIDING A RANGE OF ASSESSMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND INCLUDING HANDS-ON AND INTERACTIVE ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE STUDENT ENGAGEMENT. THREE POTENTIAL INHIBITORS TO IMPLEMENTING THE ALCOHOL MEDIA LITERACY PROGRAM IN UPPER-ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOMS WERE IDENTIFIED. THESE INCLUDED TOPIC SENSITIVITIES, CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES, AND FITTING NEW PROGRAMS INTO ALREADY BUSY SCHOOL SCHEDULES. CONCLUSION: OVERALL, THE PROGRAM CONTENT AND INDIVIDUAL LESSONS WERE WELL RECEIVED BY THE TEACHERS AND STUDENTS. THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION OF THIS PROGRAM CAN PROVIDE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WITH KEY PEDAGOGICAL STRATEGIES FOR DESIGNING CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS.

THE AIM WAS TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER SPANISH WAS RELEVANT AT A POINT IN LIFE IN WHICH THEY WERE DEVELOPING THEIR OWN NETWORKS AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: WERE READING AND WRITING IN SPANISH RELEVANT FOR THE PARTICIPANTS? DID THEY USE SPANISH WHEN ON SOCIAL MEDIA? DID THEY TEXT IN SPANISH? WAS SPANISH RELEVANT FOR THEM WHEN CONSUMING CONTENT ON ELECTRONIC MEDIA? METHODOLOGY: THIS ANALYSIS IS PART OF A LARGER STUDY ON HSS IN COMMUNITIES OF RECENT LATINO SETTLEMENT. RESPONDENTS PARTICIPATED IN AN ORAL INTERVIEW AND RESPONDED TO AN ONLINE SURVEY. DATA AND ANALYSIS: RESULTS PRESENTED HERE COME FROM A STUDY DESIGNED TO GATHER DATA ON REPORTED INTERLOCUTORS, READING AND WRITING, ELECTRONIC MEDIA CONSUMPTION, AND SOCIAL MEDIA USE. RESPONDENTS WERE 71 HSS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 19 AND 29. RESULTS WERE COMPARED WITH TWO CONTROL GROUPS: 23 L2 SPEAKERS AND 24 NATIVE SPEAKERS ATTENDING THE SAME SCHOOLS. HIGHER RELEVANCE WAS ASSUMED WHEN AN EVENT WAS REPORTED CLOSEST TO THE MOMENT OF RESPONSE. READING AND WRITING WERE CLASSIFIED AS SCHOOL, PERSONAL INTEREST, EMPLOYMENT, OTHER. RELEVANCE AS RELATED TO SOCIAL MEDIA, MUSIC, AND INTERNET USE WAS DETERMINED BY REPORTED FREQUENCY. FINDINGS: HIGHEST RELEVANCE WAS REPORTED FOR TEXTING AND LISTENING TO MUSIC LOWEST WAS REPORTED FOR CONSUMPTION OF INTERNET CONTENT. RESULTS FOR TEXTING, SOCIAL MEDIA AND PERSONAL INTEREST READING/ WRITING SUGGEST THAT FOR THESE SPEAKERS SPANISH WAS VIABLE FOR ACCRUAL OF BONDING SOCIAL CAPITAL. READING/ WRITING REPORTS SUGGEST THAT FOR MANY, SPANISH WAS ALSO VIABLE TO ATTAIN SPECIFIC ACADEMIC GOALS. ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURES TO SHIFT ARE EVIDENCED IN THE USES NOT (OR BARELY) REPORTED: READING/ WRITING RELATED TO WORK, RELIGION AND DAILY LIVING, AND CONSUMPTION OF INTERNET CONTENT. ORIGINALITY: THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON MAINTENANCE OF RELEVANCE OF A HERITAGE LANGUAGE IN THE FIRST STAGE OF ADULT LIFE. IMPLICATIONS: RESULTS SUGGEST THAT IN USING SPANISH, RESPONDENTS WERE NOT BOUND BY PHYSICAL CONTEXT OR IMMEDIATE AVAILABILITY OF INTERLOCUTORS, BUT BY THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF VIABILITY.","HERITAGE SPEAKERS; LANGUAGE MAINTENANCE; SPANISH; LITERACY; SOCIAL;   MEDIA; MIDWEST","ARTICLE","J","ENGLISH","VELAZQUEZ, I (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV NEBRASKA, DEPT MODERN LANGUAGES & LITERATURES, LINCOLN, NE 68588 USA.","1367-0069","1756-6878","INT J BILINGUAL","INT.

THE QUESTIONNAIRE CONSISTS OF TWO UNITS: WITH YES-NO QUESTIONS AND WITH FREE-ANSWERS QUESTIONS. THE EMOTIONAL SCALE WAS ASSESSED BY THREE VALUES: NEGATIVE, POSITIVE AND NEUTRAL. ACCORDING TO THE RESEARCH OUTCOMES, MOST OF THE RESPONDENTS PAY ATTENTION TO THE HEADLINE BEFORE READING THE TEXT OF THE POST (95%) AND ASSESS ITS CONTENT ACCORDING TO THE HEADLINE (90%) WHICH SHOWS HEADLINES' MANIPULATION EFFECT. 55% OF THE RESPONDENTS MANIFESTED POSITIVE EMOTIONS TOGETHER WITH THEIR POSITIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE MEDIA TEXT. SIMILARLY, THEY MANIFESTED NEGATIVE EMOTIONS TOGETHER WITH THEIR NEGATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE TEXT WHICH SHOWS THE EXTRA LINGUISTIC EFFECT ON THE CONTENT OF A MEDIA TEXT, PARTICULARLY POLITICAL, MORAL, ETHICAL OR SOCIAL. 25% OF THE RESPONDENTS WERE NEUTRAL TO THE HEADLINES AND DID NOT WANT TO READ THE TEXTS WHICH SHOWS THE HIGH LEVEL OF THEIR IMPASSIVE ATTITUDE TO THE INFORMATION FLOW.

IT HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF EATING SYMPTOMATOLOGIES, STRESS AND DEPRESSION. YET THERE REMAINS A CONSIDERABLE GAP IN ADDRESSING THE BODY IMAGE CONCERNS OF THE YOUTH. THIS EXPERIMENTAL STUDY INVOLVED DESIGNING, IMPLEMENTING AND ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A BRIEF BODY-IMAGE BASED MEDIA LITERACY INTERVENTION WITH INDIAN ADOLESCENT FEMALES AGED 12-14 YEARS. METHOD: FORTY NINE PARTICIPANTS FROM A CO-EDUCATIONAL SCHOOL IN DELHI WERE STUDIED. IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE INTERVENTION WOULD PROTECT THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP FROM NEGATIVE OUTCOMES OF EXPOSURE TO IDEALIZED MEDIA IMAGES. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP RECEIVED A FOUR COMPONENT MODULE ON MEDIA LITERACY AND BODY IMAGE. PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP ENGAGED IN A DISCUSSION ON A NEUTRAL TOPIC. STATE BODY SATISFACTION WAS ASSESSED PRIOR TO AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. MAIN FINDINGS: BODY SATISFACTION MEANS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUP WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT PRIOR TO THE INTERVENTION (T=1.004, P=. 161). HOWEVER A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS SEEN AFTER THE INTERVENTION, WITH THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP REPORTING HIGHER LEVELS OF BODY SATISFACTION (T=2.39, P=. 010). PARTICIPANTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP ALSO SHOWED HIGH AWARENESS OF THE ARTIFICIAL NATURE OF MEDIA IMAGES. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY REITERATES THE NEED TO SPREAD MEDIA LITERACY RELATED TO BEAUTY STANDARDS AMONG THE YOUTH IN INDIA. ONE TIME EXPOSURE TO MEDIA LITERACY DOES INITIATE CRITICAL THINKING, ALTHOUGH THIS IS ONLY THE INITIAL STEP IN COMBATING NEGATIVE MEDIA IMPACTS.

METHODS: THESE TEACHERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA COMPLETED AN ONLINE SURVEY DURING SPRING 2015. RESULTS: THE TEACHERS REPORTED THAT THEY INTRODUCED BRAILLE TO THEIR STUDENTS AT THE MEAN AGE OF 7.8 YEARS. THE THREE MOST COMMON REASONS REPORTED FOR INTRODUCING A STUDENT TO BRAILLE WERE THE STUDENT'S DIAGNOSIS, PRINT READING SPEED, AND PRINT READING STAMINA. THE AMOUNT OF INSTRUCTIONAL TIME IN BRAILLE LITERACY VARIED WIDELY, AND SLIGHTLY MORE THAN 60% OF THE STUDENTS WERE INITIALLY INTRODUCED TO UNCONTRACTED BRAILLE. THE TEACHERS REPORTED THAT APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THEIR STUDENTS WERE AT OR ABOVE GRADE LEVEL WITH THEIR PRINT LITERACY SKILLS, BUT ONLY ABOUT 25% WERE AT OR ABOVE GRADE LEVEL WITH THEIR BRAILLE LITERACY SKILLS. DISCUSSION: BOTH CONTRACTED AND UNCONTRACTED BRAILLE WERE USED WHEN BEGINNING BRAILLE INSTRUCTION FOR STUDENTS READING BOTH PRINT AND BRAILLE. THE ROLES OF STUDENT MOTIVATION AND CONFIDENCE APPEARED TO BE IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS WHEN DESIGNING AND PROVIDING BRAILLE LITERACY INSTRUCTION. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS: THERE ARE MANY FACTORS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN DETERMINING IF A STUDENT SHOULD TRANSITION FROM PRINT TO BRAILLE AS A PRIMARY LITERACY MEDIUM.

THE PAST DECADES HAS SEEN RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF PROFESSIONAL AND ACADEMIC INTEREST IN THE FIELD OF MEDIA LITERACY. THE THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ISSUES THAT HAVE DOMINATED THE FIELD FOR MANY YEARS HAVE ALREADY DRAWN ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS CONCEPT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND FOR THE SOCIETY. IN FACT, THE INTRODUCTION OF MEDIA EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS AND OTHER AREAS OF PUBLIC LIFE IS STILL BEING CONFRONTED WITH MANY CHALLENGES. MOREOVER, THE WIDE RANGE OF RELATED PROBLEMS IS BECOMING LESS IN THE CENTRE STAGE OF POLICY MAKING - AT THE EUROPEAN AND NON-EUROPEAN LEVEL ALIKE. THE INTERVIEWS ADDRESS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PRIORITIES OF EDUCATIONAL POLICY, WHICH SHOULD NOT BE FOCUSED ONLY ON THE TOPICS THAT CAN DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTE TO ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB CREATION.

THIS PROGRAM AIMED TO INCREASE STUDENTS' MEDIA DECONSTRUCTION SKILLS AND REDUCE INTENT TO DRINK ALCOHOL. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM IN ACHIEVING THESE GOALS THROUGH A SHORT-TERM QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL TRIAL. METHOD: ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS WERE ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE INTERVENTION GROUP (83 STUDENTS) OR A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP (82 STUDENTS). STUDENT QUESTIONNAIRES WERE ADMINISTERED AT THREE TIME POINTS (BASELINE, AFTER THE INTERVENTION GROUP COMPLETED THE PROGRAM, AND AFTER THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP COMPLETED THE PROGRAM) TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: THE INTERVENTION AND WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUPS REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER MEDIA DECONSTRUCTION SKILLS AS A RESULT OF THE INTERVENTION. BOTH GROUPS REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SOCIAL NORMS, WHEREAS THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER POSITIVE ALCOHOL EXPECTANCIES. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO SELF-EFFICACY TO REFUSE ALCOHOL, PREFERENCE FOR ALCOHOL-BRANDED MERCHANDISE, AND UNDERSTANDING OF PERSUASIVE INTENT AS A RESULT OF THE INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: TO DATE, THE MAJORITY OF ALCOHOL MEDIA LITERACY STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED IN THE UNITED STATES AND HAVE FOCUSED ON DECONSTRUCTING TELEVISION AND PRINT-BASED ADS. THIS EVALUATION PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT AN ALCOHOL MEDIA LITERACY PROGRAM THAT WAS DEVELOPED FOR A SPECIFIC CULTURAL CONTEXT, AND THAT INCORPORATES A BROAD RANGE OF MULTIMODAL ADVERTISEMENTS, CAN HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON BELIEFS AND ATTITUDES THAT ARE KNOWN PREDICTORS/PRECURSORS OF DRINKING BEHAVIORS.",NA,"ARTICLE","J","ENGLISH","GORDON, CS (REPRINT AUTHOR), AUSTRALIAN CATHOLIC UNIV, CTR HLTH & SOCIAL RES, ST PATRICKS CAMPUS,LEVEL 5,215 SPRING ST, MELBOURNE, VIC 3000, AUSTRALIA.","1937-1888","1938-4114","J STUD ALCOHOL DRUGS","J.

CONTROL) X 4 (LIFESTYLE CLASSES EMERGED FROM DATA USING LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS: COMMUNICATIVE VS. AUTONOMOUS VS. META-REFLEXIVE VS. FRACTURED). SUBJECTS SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY-FIVE ITALIAN STUDENTS DISTRIBUTED IN 47 CLASSES PARTICIPATED ANONYMOUSLY IN THE RESEARCH (51.3% FEMALES). MEASURES PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A LIFESTYLE QUESTIONNAIRE AS WELL AS THEIR ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORAL INTENTIONS AS THE DEPENDENT MEASURES. RESULTS THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE PROGRAM WAS EFFECTIVE IN CHANGING ADOLESCENTS' ATTITUDES TOWARD VIOLENCE. HOWEVER, BEHAVIORAL INTENTIONS TOWARD CONSUMPTION OF VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES WERE MODERATED BY LIFESTYLES. THOSE WITH COMMUNICATIVE RELATIONAL LIFESTYLES SHOWED FEWER INTENTIONS TO CONSUME VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES, WHILE A BOOMERANG EFFECT WAS FOUND AMONG PARTICIPANTS WITH PROBLEMATIC LIFESTYLES. CONCLUSION ADOLESCENTS' LIFESTYLES PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN INFLUENCING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AN INTERVENTION AIMED AT CHANGING BEHAVIORAL INTENTIONS TOWARD THE CONSUMPTION OF VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES. FOR THAT REASON, AUDIENCE LIFESTYLE SEGMENTATION ANALYSIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AN ESSENTIAL TECHNIQUE FOR DESIGNING, EVALUATING, AND IMPROVING MEDIA LITERACY PROGRAMS.","ADOLESCENTS; MEDIA LITERACY; LIFESTYLES; ANTIVIOLENCE ATTITUDES;;   VIOLENCE; VIDEO GAMES","ARTICLE","J","ENGLISH","RIVERA, R (REPRINT AUTHOR), VIA TORQUATO TARAMELLI 14,INT 2, I-00197 ROME, ITALY.","0193-841X","1552-3926","EVALUATION REV","EVAL.

IN PHENOMENOLOGIST'S POINT OF VIEW, ""PHENOMENOLOGY IS THE THEORY OF EXPERIENCES IN GENERAL, INCLUSIVE OF ALL MATTERS, WHETHER REAL OR INTENTIONAL, GIVEN IN EXPERIENCES, AND EVIDENTLY DISCOVERABLE IN THEM"" PHENOMENOLOGY DEMANDS THAT WE SEEK TO DISCOVER THE WORLD AS IT IS EXPERIENCED BY THOSE INVOLVED IN IT. IT IS ABOUT THE NATURE OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE AND THE MEANING THAT PEOPLE ATTACH TO THEIR EXPERIENCES. THE AXIS OF PHENOMENOLOGY IS DISCUSSION ABOUT CONSCIOUS, THE CONSCIOUS WHICH BECOMES MANIFEST IN MIND WITHOUT ANY MEDIAN AND PREJUDICE. MEDIA LITERACY IS A GATE FOR THIS CONSCIOUS AND MAYBE WE CAN SAY THAT CONSIDERING CIRCUMSTANCES OF CONTEMPORARY LIFE IN THIRD MILLENNIUM AND MODERN SOCIETY THAT ARE ENSURING CONCEPT OF MEDIA LITERACY, WITHOUT MEDIA LITERACY THIS CONSCIOUS IS DISTORTED.

METHODS: A CONSUMER PANEL (N = 1,008) COMPLETED AN ONLINE SURVEY IN NOVEMBER 2013, REPORTING EXPOSURE TO JOLIE'S STORY, CONFIDENCE APPLYING GENOMIC KNOWLEDGE TO EVALUATE HER DECISION, AND ABILITY TO INTERPRET PROVIDED GENETIC RISK INFORMATION (GENETIC LITERACY SKILLS). LINEAR AND LOGISTIC REGRESSIONS TESTED MEDIATING/MODERATING MODELS OF THESE FACTORS IN ASSOCIATION WITH OPINIONS REGARDING MASTECTOMIES. RESULTS: CONFIDENCE WITH GENOMICS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED GENETIC LITERACY SKILLS AND INCREASED MEDIA EXPOSURE, WITH A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN THE TWO. CONFIDENCE WAS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH FAVORING MASTECTOMIES FOR WOMEN WITH BRCA MUTATIONS, MEDIATING THE RELATIONSHIP WITH MEDIA EXPOSURE. RESPONDENTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO FORM OPINIONS ABOUT MASTECTOMIES IF THEY HAD HIGH GENETIC LITERACY SKILLS. CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT HAVING HIGHER GENETIC LITERACY SKILLS MAY INCREASE THE PUBLIC'S ABILITY TO FORM OPINIONS ABOUT CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF GENOMIC DISCOVERY. HOWEVER, REPEATED MEDIA EXPOSURE TO HIGH-PROFILE STORIES MAY ARTIFICIALLY INFLATE CONFIDENCE AMONG THOSE WITH LOW GENETIC LITERACY. (C) 2016 S.

IN ADDITION, THIS PAPER ALSO DETERMINES SOFT DRINK CONSUMPTION, LEVEL OF MEDIA LITERACY AND THE INFLUENCES OF THE TPB VARIABLES ON THE INTENTION OF SOFT DRINK CONSUMPTION. A CLUSTER SAMPLING METHOD WAS USED IN COLLECTING DATA WITHIN THE KLANG VALLEY AREA. THE SAMPLE CONSISTED OF 436 ADOLESCENTS FROM SECONDARY SCHOOL, AGED BETWEEN 13 TO 18 YEARS OLD. TWO MAIN SCALES UTILIZED WERE MEDIA LITERACY (ML) SCALE AND TPB SCALE. THE DESCRIPTIVE, MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION AND PEARSON PRODUCT-MOMENT CORRELATION ANALYSES WERE CARRIED OUT TO ANSWER THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES. RESULTS REVEALED THAT 36% OF RESPONDENTS DRANK A MINIMUM OF 1 CAN, BOTTLE OR GLASS OF SOFT DRINK FOR THE PAST SEVEN DAYS AND POSSESS GOOD LEVEL OF MEDIA LITERACY (35%). MEANWHILE, 14% OF VARIANCE IN ADOLESCENTS' INTENTION OF SOFT DRINK CONSUMPTION IS EXPLAINED BY TPB VARIABLES. ADDITIONALLY, THE TOTAL MEDIA LITERACY SCORE TOWARDS SOFT DRINK ADVERTISEMENT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH ATTITUDE (R = 0.250, P<.05) AND SUBJECTIVE NORMS (R = 0.174, P<.05). CONVERSELY, TOTAL MEDIA LITERACY WAS SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH INTENTION TO CONSUME SOFT DRINK (R = -0.19, P<.05) AND INDICATED THAT MEDIA LITERACY COULD LOWER THE INTENTION TO CONSUME SOFT DRINK, THUS CAN REDUCE SOFT DRINK CONSUMPTION AMONG ADOLESCENTS.

THE STUDY IN QUESTION SPECIFICALLY FEATURED PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION AND INTERVIEWS WITH RESIDENTS AND MEMBERS OF STAFF AT RETIREMENT CENTRES IN ONTARIO, CANADA. DATA COLLECTION WAS AIMED AT UNDERSTANDING HOW GAMES SUCH AS WII BOWLING ARE BEING PUT TO USE IN RETIREMENT CENTRE CONTEXTS AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH ACTIVITY. FINDINGS ON THE ONE HAND SUGGEST THAT EXERGAMES ARE DEEMED VALUABLE IN THE PROCESS OF PROMOTING BOTH SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. 'VIRTUAL' BOWLING CAN BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER IN COMMUNAL SPACES WHILE ALSO 'GETTING THEM UP' AND ACTIVE. ON THE OTHER HAND, HOWEVER, EXERGAMING PRESENTS CHALLENGES. FOR RETIREMENT CENTRE RESIDENTS, IT ENGENDERS HEALTH RISKS WHILE ALSO DEMANDING THE DEFT SYNCHRONIZATION OF MEDIA AND PHYSICAL LITERACIES. FOR ACTIVITIES COORDINATORS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF STAFF RESPONSIBLE FOR RESIDENTS' CARE, IT MEANS THEY TOO MUST STAY ABREAST OF THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR'S LATEST INNOVATIONS THEY MUST DEVELOP MEDIA AND PHYSICAL LITERACIES OF THEIR OWN. THESE FINDINGS ARE USED AS A PLATFORM FOR A BROADER DISCUSSION OF AGING, EMBODIMENT, AND MEDIA IN THE PAPER'S FINAL SECTION. AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF EXISTING CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF THE THIRD AGE, THE USE OF EXERGAMES IN RETIREMENT CENTRES IS DEEMED CONDUCIVE NOT TO INDEPENDENCE AND CONSUMERISM FULLY-FLEDGED, BUT RATHER TO THE MANIFESTATION OF 'QUASI-CONSUMERISM' AND 'QUASI-INDEPENDENCE' INSTEAD.

ALTHOUGH DEAF CHILDREN CAN SUCCESSFULLY LEARN TO READ THROUGH AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE (ASL) WITHOUT SOUND, FEW HAVE EXAMINED THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF SIGN LANGUAGE AS A POTENTIAL MODE, WITHIN THE VERBAL CODE, FOR HEARING CHILDREN. THE PURPOSE OF THE CURRENT INVESTIGATION WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF AN EDUCATIONAL VIDEO THAT UTILIZES ASL, IN ADDITION TO OTHER VERBAL AND NONVERBAL CONTENT, ON HEARING PRESCHOOLERS' EARLY ASL AND LITERACY SKILLS. PARTICIPANTS (N = 77) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THREE GROUPS: SOME VIEWED THE VIDEO IN ASL WITH SOUND SOME VIEWED IN ASL AND WITHOUT SOUND AND OTHERS DID NOT VIEW THE VIDEO. TARGETED ASL AND EARLY LITERACY SKILLS WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER VIEWING. STATISTICAL ANALYSES DETERMINED WHETHER SCORES CHANGED FROM PRETEST TO POSTTEST, AND RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT GAINS FOR CHILDREN WHO VIEWED A COMBINATION OF SOUND AND ASL. ALTHOUGH GAINS WERE NOT FOUND ON THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF PRINT AND WORD AWARENESS SKILLS, THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOUNG HEARING CHILDREN LEARNED THE CONTENT AND SKILLS THAT WERE EXPLICITLY TAUGHT IN A VIDEO THAT UTILIZED ASL, FINGERSPELLING AND PRINT ALONG WITH SOUND.

ADOLESCENT HEALTH LITERACY, SPECIFICALLY IN DENTISTRY, IS AN UNDEREXPLORED AREA DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS FORMATIVE STAGE ON AN INDIVIDUAL'S APPROACH TO HEALTHY LIFESTYLES AND BEHAVIORS. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM IS TO CONDUCT A PILOT STUDY TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF THREE MAJOR SOCIAL MEDIA OUTLETS - TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND YOUTUBE - IN SUPPORTING ADOLESCENTS' ORAL HEALTH LITERACY (OHL) EDUCATION. METHODS: A RANDOM SAMPLE OF 22 ADOLESCENTS (AGED 14-16 YEARS) FROM AN ENGLISH-MEDIUM INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL IN HONG KONG PROVIDED INFORMED CONSENT. SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, INCLUDING ENGLISH LANGUAGE BACKGROUND, SOCIAL MEDIA USAGE, AND DENTAL EXPERIENCE WERE COLLECTED VIA A QUESTIONNAIRE. A PRE- AND POST-TEST OF OHL (REALD-30) WAS ADMINISTERED BY TWO TRAINED, CALIBRATED EXAMINERS. FOLLOWING PRE-TEST, PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THREE SOCIAL MEDIA OUTLETS: TWITTER, FACEBOOK, OR YOUTUBE. PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED ALERTS POSTED DAILY FOR 5 CONSECUTIVE DAYS REQUIRING ONLINE ACCESSING OF MODIFIED AND ORIGINAL OHL EDUCATION MATERIALS. ONE-WAY ANOVA (ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE) WAS USED TO COMPARE THE MEAN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRE- AND THE POST-TEST RESULTS AMONG THE THREE SOCIAL MEDIA. RESULTS: NO ASSOCIATIONS WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE SOCIAL MEDIA ALLOCATED AND PARTICIPANTS' SOCIODEMOGRAPHICS, INCLUDING ENGLISH LANGUAGE BACKGROUND, SOCIAL MEDIA USAGE, AND DENTAL EXPERIENCE. OF THE THREE SOCIAL MEDIA, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN LITERACY ASSESSMENT SCORES WERE EVIDENT FOR PARTICIPANTS WHO RECEIVED ORAL HEALTH EDUCATION MESSAGES VIA FACEBOOK (P=.02) AND YOUTUBE (P=.005). CONCLUSIONS: BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE PILOT STUDY, FACEBOOK AND YOUTUBE MAY BE MORE EFFICIENT MEDIA OUTLETS FOR OHL PROMOTION AND EDUCATION AMONG ADOLESCENT SCHOOL CHILDREN WHEN COMPARED TO TWITTER.

MULTIVARIATE HIERARCHICAL REGRESSION WAS USED TO COMPARE CHANGES FROM BASELINE TO FOLLOW-UP BETWEEN THE INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS. RESULTS COMPARED WITH CONTROLS, AT THE FIRST POST-TEST, STUDENTS IN THE TRAINED AND UNTRAINED GROUPS REPORTED INCREASED KNOWLEDGE OF FIVE CORE CONCEPTS/KEY QUESTIONS OF MEDIA LITERACY, INCREASED SELF-RATED EXPOSURE TO MEDIA VIOLENCE, AS WELL AS STRONGER BELIEFS THAT MEDIA VIOLENCE AFFECTS VIEWERS AND THAT PEOPLE CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES BY WATCHING LESS.

WE AIMED TO DETERMINE IF AN ANTI-SMOKING MEDIA LITERACY CURRICULUM IMPROVES STUDENTS' MEDIA LITERACY AND AFFECTS FACTORS RELATED TO ADOLESCENT SMOKING. METHODSWE RECRUITED 1170 9TH-GRADE STUDENTS FROM 64 CLASSROOMS IN 3 PUBLIC URBAN HIGH SCHOOLS. STUDENTS WERE RANDOMIZED BY CLASSROOM TO A MEDIA LITERACY CURRICULUM VERSUS A STANDARD EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM. IN AN INTENT-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS, WE USED MULTILEVEL MODELING TO DETERMINE IF CHANGES IN STUDY OUTCOMES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CURRICULAR INTERVENTION, CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE STUDENT COVARIATES AND THE CLUSTERING OF STUDENTS WITHIN CLASSROOMS. RESULTSAMONG PARTICIPANTS, MEAN AGE WAS 14.5 YEARS AND 51% WERE MALE, WITH NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS BETWEEN GROUPS. SMOKING MEDIA LITERACY CHANGED MORE AMONG INTERVENTION PARTICIPANTS COMPARED WITH CONTROL PARTICIPANTS (0.24 VS. 0.08, P < .001). COMPARED WITH CONTROLS, INTERVENTION STUDENTS EXHIBITED A GREATER REDUCTION IN THE PERCEIVED PREVALENCE OF SMOKING (-14.0% VS. -4.6%, P < .001).

MEDIA LITERACY STRATEGIES CAN PLAY A KEY ROLE IN HELPING TEACHERS TO FULFIL THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR PREPARING CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS TO USE THE INTERNE, TELEVISION AND OTHER MEDIA THAT SURROUND THEM. OUR APPROACH REFLECTS THE NEED TO EDUCATE NOT ONLY IN TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES, BUT ALSO IN THEIR RESPONSIBLE AND MEANINGFUL USE. ONE OF THE IMPORTANT GOALS OF CURRENT RELIGIOUS TEACHING COULD BE TO STIMULATE CRITICAL AND CREATIVE THINKING AND PROMOTE DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP AND THE ETHICAL VALUES.

MULTIMODALITY THEORY OFFERS A BROADLY SEMIOTIC APPROACH TO ANALYSING A RANGE OF COMMUNICATIVE FORMS.

IT DOCUMENTS THE EXPERIENCE OF A NOVICE TEACHER WHO, FLUMMOXED BY AN ACCIDENTAL ENCOUNTER BETWEEN HER STUDENTS AND A HOMELESS PERSON, TRANSFORMED AN UNCOMFORTABLE EXPERIENCE INTO A TEACHABLE MOMENT. CHILDREN'S QUESTIONS ABOUT HOMELESSNESS BECAME THE ORGANIZING FRAME FOR LEARNING EXPERIENCE, AS THE INSTRUCTOR HELPED CHILDREN MAKE SENSE OF THE INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET, ANALYZE POPULAR CULTURE FILMS AND NEWS MEDIA, AND CONDUCT INTERVIEWS WITH COMMUNITY LEADERS AND ADVOCATES FOR THE HOMELESS. THE INQUIRY PROCESS RESULTED IN A COLLABORATIVELY PRODUCED MULTIMEDIA PROJECT, CREATED BY CHILDREN. THE CASE STUDY HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR PRE- AND IN-SERVICE TEACHER EDUCATION FOR DIGITAL AND MEDIA LITERACY.

THIS PARADIGM ORIGINATES IN THE INTERFACE SINCE IT ALLOWS MULTIDIRECTIONAL AND MULTIMEDIA COMMUNICATIONS THROUGH INTERACTIONS WITH THE ELEMENTS OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED. THIS RESEARCH DESCRIBES THE DIFFERENT AESTHETIC, NARRATIVE, EMOTIONAL AND VALUE ELEMENTS THAT ARE INTEGRATED WITHIN THE CULTURAL HYPERMEDIA INTERFACES. THESE HYPERMEDIA ELEMENTS ARE FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENTS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE CREATION OF EDUCATIONAL INTERACTIVE MEDIA PRODUCTS. THE COMMUNICATIVE FUNCTIONS ARE INTERCHANGEABLE BETWEEN SENDER-RECEPTOR, AUTHOR-READER-AUTHOR, CREATOR-USER, PROFESSOR-STUDENT... THANKS TO THE INTRODUCTION OF MULTIMEDIA INTERACTIVE EXPRESSIONS AND TECHNOLOGICAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ALLOW SEVERAL TYPES OF INTERACTIONS. THIS FLEXIBLE FUNCTIONALITY GENERATES NEW COMMUNICATIVE AS WELL AS DRAMATIC MODELS OF INTERACTIVE NARRATIVE, WHERE THE INTERACTION OF RECEPTORS-SENDERS AND READER-AUTHORS WITH THE NARRATIVE ACTIONS OCCUR AT THE CHARACTER OR AVATAR LEVEL. THE INTERFACIAL AESTHETIC, NARRATIVE, EMOTIONAL AND VALUE ELEMENTS ARE STUDIED, ANALYZED AND DESCRIBED IN DETAIL THANKS TO AN INNOVATIVE MODEL OF ANALYSIS THAT CAN BE USED TO FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION AND DESIGN OF INTERACTIVE EDUTAINMENT MEDIA PRODUCTS.

METHOD: A SURVEY FORM WAS ADMINISTERED IN REGULARLY-SCHEDULED CLASSES TO 546 EIGHTH- AND TWELFTH-GRADE STUDENTS THAT INCLUDED THE SMOKING MEDIA LITERACY (SML) SCALE AND ITEMS ASSESSING CIGARETTE USE. LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS USED TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP OF SMOKING MEDIA LITERACY WITH CURRENT SMOKING, AND ALSO SEPARATELY FOR SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SMOKING IN THE FUTURE, AS DEPENDENT DICHOTOMOUS VARIABLES. RESULTS: SMOKING MEDIA LITERACY WAS LOWER AMONG THE HUNGARIAN ADOLESCENTS THAN WHAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN AMERICAN ADOLESCENTS. MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS RESULTS SHOWED SMOKING MEDIA LITERACY TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED RISK OF CURRENT SMOKING STATUS AT A SIMILAR LEVEL TO THAT FOUND IN AMERICAN ADOLESCENTS. HOWEVER, UNLIKE PREVIOUS RESEARCH IN AMERICAN ADOLESCENTS, SMOKING MEDIA LITERACY AND SUSCEPTIBILITY TO FUTURE SMOKING WAS NOT ASSOCIATED. REDUCED SMOKING MAY BE MOST ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPRESENTATION-REALITY DOMAIN OF MEDIA LITERACY, WHICH RELATES RECOGNITION OF WHAT IS PORTRAYED IN THE MEDIA WITH REALITY.

THE PAPER AIMS TO EDUCATE LIBRARIANS OF THE MANY TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS, WHICH COULD BE EMPLOYED TO ENRICH LIBRARY INSTRUCTION. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - USING THE OAKLEAF INFORMATION LITERACY INSTRUCTION ASSESSMENT CYCLE (ILIAC), LIBRARIANS GATHERED ASSESSMENT DATA AND DETERMINED STUDENT RESEARCH SKILL DEFICITS IN FALL 2009. TO ADDRESS KNOWLEDGE GAPS, THE AUTHORS SYSTEMATICALLY DESIGNED A MULTI-MEDIA TUTORIAL WITH TEN TOOLS. FINDINGS - THE PAPER FINDS THAT THE TUTORIAL IDENTIFIED STUDENTS' AREAS OF WEAKNESS PRIOR TO LIBRARY INSTRUCTION. AS A RESULT, LIBRARIANS COULD FOCUS ON IDENTIFIED TOPICS DURING THE SESSION AND INCREASE STUDENT LEARNING. ANNUAL RE-EVALUATION OF THE TOOLS AND DATA ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO UPDATE THE PROGRAM AND ENSURE STUDENT LEARNING OCCURS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE LIMITATIONS OF THE CREATION PROCESS INCLUDE INCOMPLETE SOFTWARE EVALUATION EARLY IN THE PROCESS LEARNING HOW TO COLLABORATE WITH DIFFERENT PROJECT MANAGEMENT STYLES, DEVELOPING A REALISTIC TIMELINE, AND THE NEED FOR A ROBUST ASSESSMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO COLLECT DATA. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS TUTORIAL NEEDS MORE EMPIRICAL EVALUATION. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE PAPER MAY HELP INFORM THOSE PLANNING TO CREATE A TUTORIAL BY SUGGESTING USEFUL, LOW-COST TOOLS FOR ITS CREATION AND DETERMINING HOW TO INCORPORATE STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES AND ASSESSMENT INTO ASYNCHRONOUS INSTRUCTION.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO CONDUCT A SHORT-TERM, RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MEDIA DETECTIVE FOR ACHIEVING THESE GOALS. METHODS: ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO CONDITIONS TO EITHER RECEIVE THE MEDIA DETECTIVE PROGRAM (N = 344) OR SERVE IN A WAITING LIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 335). RESULTS: BOYS IN THE MEDIA DETECTIVE GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LESS INTEREST IN ALCOHOL-BRANDED MERCHANDISE THAN BOYS IN THE CONTROL GROUP. ALSO, STUDENTS WHO WERE IN THE MEDIA DETECTIVE GROUP AND HAD USED ALCOHOL OR TOBACCO IN THE PAST REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LESS INTENTION TO USE AND MORE SELF-EFFICACY TO REFUSE SUBSTANCES THAN STUDENTS WHO WERE IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND HAD PREVIOUSLY USED ALCOHOL OR TOBACCO. CONCLUSIONS: THIS EVALUATION PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT MEDIA DETECTIVE CAN BE EFFECTIVE FOR SUBSTANCE USE PREVENTION IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN. NOTABLY, MEDIA-RELATED COGNITIONS ABOUT ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO PRODUCTS ARE MALLEABLE AND RELEVANT TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF SUBSTANCE USE BEHAVIORS DURING LATE CHILDHOOD. THE FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT MEDIA LITERACY-BASED INTERVENTIONS MAY SERVE AS BOTH A UNIVERSAL AND A TARGETED PREVENTION PROGRAM THAT HAS POTENTIAL FOR ASSISTING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN IN MAKING HEALTHIER, MORE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT USE OF ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO PRODUCTS.

IN THIS STUDY, THE SELECTION OF FINLAND AND IRELAND CURRICULA IS RELATED WITH THOSE COUNTRIES' BEING THE PIONEERING COUNTRIES IN MLE AND THE STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES IN THEIR CURRICULA. IN OTHER WORDS, THE SELECTION OF THESE COUNTRIES SERVES AS A MODEL IN TERMS OF APPROACHING TO MLE AS A SEPARATE COURSE (TURKEY), IN A STRAND UNIT (IRELAND) AND INTERDISCIPLINARY MANNER (FINLAND). THE METHOD USED IN THIS STUDY WAS DOCUMENT ANALYSIS. THE DOCUMENTS ANALYZED IN THE STUDY WERE THE PRIMARY SCHOOL CURRICULUM OF THESE COUNTRIES AND ALSO DOCUMENTS, SUCH AS REPORTS, BOOKS AND JOURNALS, PUBLISHED BY GOVERNMENTAL AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) WORKING ON MEDIA LITERACY EDUCATION. SINCE A STANDARD MLE FOR EUROPEAN COUNTRIES DOES NOT EXIST, THE CURRICULA OF PRIMARY SCHOOL EDUCATION OF TURKEY, IRELAND, AND FINLAND WERE ANALYZED AND INTERPRETED IN TERMS OF (A) GENERAL OUTCOMES AND LEARNING OUTCOMES OF THE CURRICULA, (B) CONTENT, (C) LEARNING SITUATION (METHODS AND TECHNIQUES) AND (D) ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION STRATEGIES. THIS STUDY REVEALED THAT IN THE VISION OF PRIMARY SCHOOL CURRICULA OF TURKEY, THERE ARE NOT ANY OBJECTIVES RELATED TO MLE UNLIKE FINLAND AND IRELAND CURRICULA. WHEN ANALYZED THE CURRICULUM OF EACH COURSE THIS STUDY ALSO REVEALED THAT THE OBJECTIVES RELATED TO MLE ARE ONLY IMPLEMENTED IN TURKISH CURRICULUM (1-5). ON THE CONTRARY, IN IRELAND THERE ARE OBJECTIVES RELATED TO MLE IN ENGLISH, VISUAL ARTS, MATHEMATICS, IRISH LANGUAGE, AND MOSTLY IN SCIENCE AND SOCIAL PERSONAL AND HEALTH (SPHE) CURRICULA AND IT IS INCLUDED IN THE OBJECTIVES OF CORE CURRICULUM IN FINLAND. IN ADDITION TO THIS, THE OBJECTIVES AND LEARNING OUTCOMES OF TURKEY'S MLE CURRICULUM SEEMS TO AIM AT GAINING KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING THE ISSUES ALTHOUGH THEY ARE FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING ATTITUDE, SKILLS AND VALUES AND ALSO DEVELOPING ACTIVE CITIZENSHIP, INTERCULTURAL COMMUNICATION, CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY IN FINLAND'S AND IRELAND'S CURRICULA. CONSIDERING THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT MLE SHOULD BE A SKILL-BASED TEACHING RATHER THAN A STAND-ALONE SUBJECT IN PRIMARY SCHOOL CURRICULA.","MEDIA LITERACY EDUCATION; PRIMARY SCHOOL CURRICULA; TURKEY; IRELAND;;   FINLAND","ARTICLE","J","ENGLISH","TANRIVERDI, B (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV KOCAELI, FAC EDUC, EDUC SCI DEPT, TR-41380 IZMIT, KOCAELI, TURKEY.","1303-0485",NA,"KURAM UYGULAMA EGI","KURAM UYGULAMADA EGIT.

THE AIM OF THE PROJECT WAS TO IMPROVE STANDARDS IN LITERACY, WITH WRITING AS A PARTICULAR FOCUS AND MAKE TEACHERS MORE AWARE OF THE EFFECTIVE USE OF MEDIA RESOURCES. TEACHERS WERE PROVIDED WITH AN INFORMATION PACK CONTAINING SAMPLE LESSONS BUT WERE ACTIVELY ENCOURAGED TO IMPLEMENT THE PROJECT IN WHICHEVER WAY THEY CHOSE. QUESTIONNAIRES GIVEN TO TEACHERS BEFORE AND AFTER THE PROJECT REFLECTED A MORE POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS USING MEDIA RESOURCES AT THE END. PUPILS, AGED BETWEEN 8 AND 11 YEARS OLD, WERE GIVEN WRITING JOURNALS AS PART OF THE PROJECT AND FOCUS GROUPS INTERVIEWED. IT PROVED DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN IF STANDARDS HAD IMPROVED ALTHOUGH PUPIL ENTHUSIASM WAS A RECOGNISABLE FEATURE. THE VALUE OF LEARNING ACROSS THE CURRICULUM WAS ANOTHER ELEMENT THAT EMERGED DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROJECT.

METHODOLOGICALLY RIGOROUS EVALUATIONS OF PREVENTION PROGRAMS DIRECTED TO YOUNGER, MIXED-SEX, UNIVERSAL AUDIENCES ARE LARGELY ABSENT. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE WAS TO EVALUATE A THEORETICALLY INFORMED MEDIA LITERACY PROGRAM DELIVERED TO A MIXED-SEX, UNIVERSAL, YOUNG ADOLESCENT AUDIENCE. METHOD: FIVE HUNDRED FORTY GRADE 8 STUDENTS (MEAN AGE 13.62 YEARS, SD 0.37 YEARS) FROM 4 SCHOOLS PARTICIPATED WITH A TOTAL OF 11 CLASSES RECEIVING THE 8-LESSON MEDIA LITERACY PROGRAM (126 GIRLS AND 107 BOYS) AND 13 COMPARISON CLASSES RECEIVING THEIR NORMAL SCHOOL LESSONS (147 GIRLS AND 160 BOYS). SHAPE AND WEIGHT CONCERN (PRIMARY OUTCOME VARIABLE) AND SEVEN ADDITIONAL EATING DISORDER RISK FACTORS (E.G., DIETING, MEDIA INTERNALIZATION) WERE MEASURED WITH VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRES AT BASELINE, POSTPROGRAM, AND 6- AND 30-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: LINEAR MIXED MODEL ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED USING A 2 (GROUP: MEDIA LITERACY PROGRAM, CONTROL) X 3 (TIME: POSTPROGRAM, 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, 30-MONTH FOLLOW-UP) X 2 (SEX: GIRLS, BOYS) MIXED WITHIN-BETWEEN DESIGN, WITH BASELINE ENTERED AS A COVARIATE. MAIN EFFECTS FOR GROUP, FAVORING THE MEDIA LITERACY PROGRAM, WERE FOUND FOR SHAPE AND WEIGHT CONCERN (EFFECT SIZE [ES] = 0.29), DIETING (ES = 0.26), BODY DISSATISFACTION (ES = 0.20), INEFFECTIVENESS (ES = 0.23), AND DEPRESSION (ES = 0.26). CONCLUSION: MEDIA LITERACY CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR REDUCING SHAPE AND WEIGHT CONCERN AND OTHER EATING DISORDER RISK FACTORS LONG-TERM IN A UNIVERSAL MIXED-SEX, YOUNG ADOLESCENT POPULATION.

METHOD: STUDENTS FROM SIX CLASSES (N = 127, MEAN AGE 15.0 YEARS, SD 0.4) AND TWO SCHOOLS PARTICIPATED. LINEAR MIXED-MODEL ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED BY GROUP (3: PERFECTIONISM, MEDIA LITERACY, CONTROL), TIME (2: POSTPROGRAM, 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP) AND EATING DISORDER RISK STATUS (2: HIGH, LOW), WITH BASELINE OBSERVATIONS INCLUDED AS A COVARIATE. RESULTS: AN INTERACTION EFFECT FAVORING THE PERFECTIONISM PROGRAM AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP WAS FOUND FOR CONCERN OVER MISTAKES (EFFECT SIZE 0.45). A MAIN EFFECT FOR GROUP, ALSO FAVORING THE PERFECTIONISM PROGRAM, WAS FOUND FOR PERSONAL STANDARDS (EFFECT SIZE 0.44). HIGH-RISK PARTICIPANTS (I.E., THOSE WITH HIGH LEVELS OF SHAPE AND WEIGHT CONCERN AT BASELINE) BENEFITED MOST FROM THE PERFECTIONISM PROGRAM WITH RELIABLE CHANGE INDICES INDICATING FAVORABLE RATES OF IMPROVEMENT BEYOND CHANCE ON ALL OF THE VARIABLES, WHEREAS THE MEDIA LITERACY AND CONTROL PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED A COMPARABLE RATE OF CHANGE DURING THE COURSE OF THE STUDY. CONCLUSIONS: TARGETING PERFECTIONISM REPRESENTS A PROMISING PREVENTION OPTION THAT REQUIRES FURTHER INVESTIGATION IN CHILDREN OF MID-ADOLESCENCE AGE, AND FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE DEMOGRAPHIC MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM MEDIA LITERACY.","PERFECTIONISM; MEDIA LITERACY; EATING DISORDERS; PREVENTION","ARTICLE","J","ENGLISH","WILKSCH, SM (REPRINT AUTHOR), FLINDERS UNIV S AUSTRALIA, SCH PSYCHOL, POB 2100, ADELAIDE, SA 5001, AUSTRALIA.","0890-8567",NA,"J AM ACAD CHILD PSY","J.

NINE META-TOPICS ARE USED TO SORT STORIES ACROSS A RANGE OF MAJOR INFLUENCES SHAPING THE HEALTH STATUS OF POPULATIONS ADAPTED FROM THE DOCUMENT TOWARD A HEALTHY FUTURE (SECOND REPORT ON THE HEALTH OF CANADIANS (1999)) (TAHF). A TOTAL OF 4732 STORIES WERE ANALYZED FROM 13 CANADIAN DAILY NEWSPAPERS (10 ENGLISH, 3 FRENCH LANGUAGE) USING A CONSTRUCTED WEEK PER QUARTER METHOD. STORIES WERE SAMPLED FROM EACH CHOSEN NEWSPAPER FOR THE YEARS 1993, 1995, 1997 AND 2001. 72% (N = 3405) OF STORIES IN THIS ANALYSIS WERE FROM ENGLISH-LANGUAGE PAPERS, 28% (N = 1327) WERE FROM FRENCH-LANGUAGE PAPERS. TOPICS RELATED TO HEALTH CARE (DEALING EITHER WITH ISSUES OF SERVICE PROVISION AND DELIVERY OR MANAGEMENT AND REGULATION) DOMINATED NEWSPAPER STORIES, ACCOUNTING FOR 65% OF ALL STORIES. PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT TOPICS ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 13% OF ALL STORIES, THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT ABOUT 6% OF STORIES, PERSONAL HEALTH PRACTICES ABOUT 5% OF STORIES, AND SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES IN HEALTH RESEARCH ABOUT 4% OF STORIES. OTHER INFLUENCES UPON HEALTH IDENTIFIED IN TAHF WERE RARELY MENTIONED.

AIMS. THE PURPOSE OF THE CURRENT STUDY WAS TO ASCERTAIN THE EFFECTS OF A HISTORY OF CM IN EARLY CHILDHOOD ON LATER LANGUAGE AND LITERACY SKILL DEVELOPMENT. SAMPLE. FORTY-THREE CHILDREN FROM GRADE 1 AND GRADE 2, BETWEEN 6 AND 8 YEARS OLD WITH AN EARLY HISTORY OF OM AND 43 CONTROL CHILDREN, MATCHED FOR CHRONOLOGICAL AGE, GENDER AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS, PARTICIPATED IN THIS STUDY. METHODS. CHILDREN WERE TESTED ON MULTIPLE MEASURES OF PHONOLOGICAL AWARENESS, SEMANTIC KNOWLEDGE, NARRATION AND READING ABILITY. THE PERFORMANCE OF CHILDREN WITH AND WITHOUT A HISTORY OF CM WAS COMPARED ON THE DIFFERENT MEASURES. RESULTS. THERE WAS A GENERAL TENDENCY FOR CHILDREN WITH A HISTORY OF CM TO ACHIEVE LOWER SCORES ON PHONOLOGICAL AWARENESS SKILLS OF ALLITERATION, RHYME AND NON-WORD READING, SEMANTIC SKILLS OF EXPRESSIVE VOCABULARY AND WORD DEFINITIONS AND READING THAN NON-OM CHILDREN.

CONTROLLING FOR ALL POTENTIAL CONFOUNDERS OF SMOKING, WE FOUND THAT AN INCREASE OF ONE POINT (OUT OF 10) IN SML WAS INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH AN ODDS RATIO FOR SMOKING OF.84 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI].71-99). COMPARED WITH STUDENTS BELOW THE MEDIAN SCORE ON THE SML SCALE, STUDENTS ABOVE THE MEDIAN HAD AN ODDS RATIO FOR SMOKING OF.57 (95% CI.37-87).

DESIGN: ON THE BASIS OF AN ESTABLISHED THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK, 120 POTENTIAL ITEMS WERE GENERATED, AND ITEMS WERE ELIMINATED OR ALTERED ON THE BASIS OF INPUT FROM EXPERTS AND STUDENTS. CROSS-SECTIONAL RESPONSES TO SCALE ITEMS, DEMOGRAPHICS, SMOKING-RELATED VARIABLES, AND MULTIPLE COVARIATES WERE OBTAINED TO REFINE THE SCALE AND DETERMINE ITS RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY. SETTING: ONE LARGE PITTSBURGH, PA, HIGH SCHOOL. PARTICIPANTS: A TOTAL OF 1211 HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AGED 14 TO 18 YEARS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CURRENT SMOKING, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SMOKING, ATTITUDES TOWARD SMOKING, AND SMOKING NORMS. RESULTS: FACTOR ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED A STRONG 1-FACTOR SCALE WITH 18 ITEMS (ALPHA=0.87). AFTER CONTROLLING FOR ALL CO-VARIATE DATA, SML HAD A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION WITH CURRENT SMOKING (P=.01), SUSCEPTIBILITY (P<.001), AND ATTITUDES (P<.001), BUT NOT NORMS (P=.42). CONTROLLING FOR ALL COVARIATES, AN INCREASE OF 1 POINT ON THE 10-POINT SML SCALE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A 22% DECREASE IN THE ODDS OF BEING A SMOKER AND A 31% DECREASE IN THE ODDS OF BEING SUSCEPTIBLE TO SMOKING. CONCLUSIONS: SMOKING MEDIA LITERACY CAN BE MEASURED WITH EXCELLENT RELIABILITY AND CONCURRENT CRITERION VALIDITY.

CHANNEL ONE IS A PUBLIC-AFFAIRS PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES 10 MINUTES OF NEWS AND 2 MINUTES OF PAID PRODUCT ADVERTISING OR PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS. ADVOCATES ASSERT THAT IT INCREASES PUBLIC-AFFAIRS KNOWLEDGE, BUT CRITICS CHARGE THAT IT GARNERS A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE FOR TEEN-TARGETED ADVERTISING. THIS EXPERIMENT ANALYZED THE DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF CHANNEL ONE DEPENDING ON WHETHER EARLY-ADOLESCENT VIEWERS RECEIVED A MEDIA-LITERACY LESSON IN CONJUNCTION WITH VIEWING THE PROGRAM. OUTCOMES INCLUDED PERCEPTIONS OF CHANNEL ONE NEWS PROGRAMMING, RECALL OF PROGRAM CONTENT AND ADVERTISING, MATERIALISM, AND POLITICAL EFFICACY. METHODS. RESEARCHERS USED A POSTTEST-ONLY FIELD EXPERIMENT (N = 240) OF SEVENTH-AND EIGHTH-GRADE STUDENTS USING RANDOM ASSIGNMENT TO CONDITIONS. CONDITIONS INCLUDED A CONTROL GROUP, A GROUP THAT RECEIVED A FACT-BASED LESSON, AND A GROUP THAT RECEIVED THE SAME LESSON CONTENT USING A MORE EMOTIVE TEACHING STYLE. IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THE EMOTION-ADDED LESSON CONDITION WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE LOGIC-ONLY LESSON CONDITION BECAUSE OF ITS MOTIVATIONAL COMPONENT. RESULTS. ON AVERAGE, STUDENTS REMEMBERED MORE ADS FROM CHANNEL ONE THAN NEWS STORIES. PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP REMEMBERED FEWER NEWS STORIES THAN DID THE GROUPS THAT RECEIVED THE LESSONS. STUDENTS REPORTED HAVING PURCHASED DURING THE PRECEDING 3 MONTHS AN AVERAGE OF 2.5 ITEMS ADVERTISED ON THE PROGRAM. BOTH FACT-BASED AND AFFECT-ADDED TRAINING INCREASED STUDENT SKEPTICISM TOWARD ADVERTISERS. AS EXPECTED, STUDENT LIKING OF THE PROGRAM ENHANCED THEIR LEARNING FROM IT AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF POLITICAL EFFICACY. STUDENTS HELD MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE ROLE OF THEIR SCHOOL IN THE PRODUCTION OF CHANNEL ONE. CONCLUSIONS. THE USE OF CHANNEL ONE BY SCHOOLS CAN HAVE BENEFITS, BUT THESE COME WITH RISK THAT SOME MAY CONSIDER UNACCEPTABLE. ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, STUDENT LIKING OF THE PROGRAM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR POLITICAL EFFICACY. ALTHOUGH THOSE WHO RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO PROGRAM CONTENT AND PRESENTATION STYLE LEARNED MORE FROM IT, THEY ALSO TENDED TO WANT THINGS THAT THEY SAW IN THE ADVERTISEMENTS. THE DATA THEREFORE SHOW THAT THE PROGRAM CAN PROVIDE SOME BENEFITS TO YOUNG ADOLESCENTS, BUT THE RESULTS ALSO PROVIDE JUSTIFICATION FOR CONCERNS ABOUT THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE CLASSROOM.","MEDIA EFFECTS; ADVERTISING; ADOLESCENTS; SCHOOLS; MEDIA LITERACY;;   CHANNEL ONE; PUBLIC AFFAIRS; EFFICACY; CIVIC EDUCATION","ARTICLE","J","ENGLISH","AUSTIN, EW (REPRINT AUTHOR), WASHINGTON STATE UNIV, EDWARD R MURROW SCH COMMUN, POB 642520, PULLMAN, WA 99164 USA.","0031-4005",NA,"PEDIATRICS","PEDIATRICS","MAR","3","E423","E433","11","PEDIATRICS","PEDIATRICS","017QV","ISI000235709000008","ALCOHOL; ADOLESCENTS; EDUCATION","GOLD","16510621",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PEDIATRICS"

SPENDING THE MAJORITY OF THEIR LEISURE TIME WITH MASS MEDIA PUTS CANADIANS AT INCREASED HEALTH RISK. OUR REVIEW OF THE RESEARCH LITERATURE SHOWS THAT TELEVISION (TV) VIEWING AND CONTENT ARE LINKED TO POTENTIAL CONSUMER HEALTH RISKS DUE TO DEVELOPED HEALTH ATTITUDES, BELIEFS, AND BEHAVIOURS. THE ASSOCIATED HEALTH RISKS OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH ARE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN. EXCESSIVE TV VIEWING HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH OBESITY DEVELOPMENT, INCREASED ENERGY CONSUMPTION, REDUCED ENERGY EXPENDITURE, NEGATIVE BODY IMAGE DEVELOPMENT, AND REDUCED CONCERN WITH THE CONCEPT OF SELF-CARE. MEDIA LITERACY, THE ABILITY TO VIEW CRITICALLY AND UNDERSTAND MEDIATED MESSAGES, IS A POSSIBLE TECHNIQUE TO MITIGATE THESE ADVERSE EFFECTS. THE ENHANCED INCLUSION OF MEDIA LITERACY CONCEPTS IN HEALTH EDUCATION ACTIVITIES OF DIETETIC PRACTICE IS ADVOCATED. DIETITIANS COULD INCREASE THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF RESEARCH FINDINGS ON THE HEALTH-RELATED EFFECTS OF MASS MEDIA USE AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF INCLUDING MEDIA LITERACY IN DAILY PRACTICE.

SUBJECTS PARTICIPANTS WERE A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 35 PARENTS FROM HEAD START PROGRAMS. DESIGN THIS STUDY USED A PRETEST-POSTTEST, COMPARISON CONDITION-INTERVENTION CONDITION DESIGN. INTERVENTION THE 35 PARENTS PARTICIPATED IN BOTH A FOUR-WEEK FOOD SAFETY CURRICULUM (TO SERVE AS AN EDUCATIONAL PLACEBO, COMPARISON CONDITION) THAT WAS FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY A FOUR-WEEK MEDIA LITERACY NUTRITION EDUCATION CURRICULUM (INTERVENTION CONDITION). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES EVALUATION MEASURES INCLUDED PARENTS' UNDERSTANDING OF THE PERSUASIVE TECHNIQUES OF COMMERCIALS ABILITY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TRUTHS AND CLAIMS IN ADVERTISING AND OUTCOME EXPECTATIONS, VALUES, SELF-EFFICACY, AND BEHAVIORS IN RELATION TO TALKING ABOUT TELEVISION ADVERTISEMENTS WITH CHILDREN WHILE CO-VIEWING OR IN RESPONSE TO PURCHASE REQUESTS IN THE GROCERY STORE. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PAIRED T TESTS, ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE, AND X-2 ANALYSES WERE USED.

ASSESSMENT OF GENERAL AND SPECIFIC RISK FACTORS WAS CARRIED OUT AT BASELINE, POSTINTERVENTION AND 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: AT POSTINTERVENTION THE MEDIA, LITERACY GROUP HAD LOWER MEAN SCORES ON WEIGHT CONCERN THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (P =0.007) BUT THE SELF-ESTEEM GROUP DID, NOT. THERE WERE SOME DIFFERENCES ON SELF-ESTEEM MEASURES AT THE 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. DISCUSSION: MEDIA LITERACY PROGRAMS COMBINED WITH AN INTERACTIVE, STUDENT-CENTERED FRAMEWORK MAY POTENTIALLY BE A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE WAY OF REDUCING RISK FACTORS FOR EATING DISORDERS.
